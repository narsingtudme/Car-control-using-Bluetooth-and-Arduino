# Car-control-using-Bluetooth-and-Arduino
The Car Control project involves using an Arduino microcontroller and Bluetooth communication to remotely control the movement of a small car. The Arduino is responsible for receiving commands from a Bluetooth-enabled device, interpreting those commands, and then sending appropriate signals to control the car's motors.
